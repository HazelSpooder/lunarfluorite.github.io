	I have been assigned the task of investigating the potential launch site of the object on an unknown island. With how stretched thin our forces have been from various robot attacks in the previous few days, I am being sent out alone, but will be accompanied by several military drones. I am expected to find out how this spacecraft was launched, who is responsible for it, and what kind of threat it could pose to the planet. I am currently heading towards the island as I write this, and will report any of my findings. <br>
